I made this configs with mint xfce. This also works on mint cinnamon installation but need to download some additional packages like, xfce4-panel,xfdesktop,xfce4-settings, xfce4-power-manager etc.

First install the packages.  sudo apt install bc openbox obconf playerctl xcompmgr,parcellite,numlockx, rofi, polybar,lxappearance.
Then copy the files inside the config folder to .config folder
Also Open the .config/polybar/scripts --- Right click each script and click make executable
Copy the files from the usr/bin to /usr/bin
Then extract the fonts.tar.gz to the /usr/share/fonts/ 

##Optional Icons,themes,
Extract the Cachyos-nord theme,Icons to /usr/share/icons ,/usr/share/themes

Then open the etc/udev/rules.d/90-backlight.rules with your text editor and replace username with your linux username

###Optional If you want to replace bash with zsh follow this
sudo apt install zsh
Copy zsh-autosuggestions,zsh-history-substring-search,zsh-syntax-highlighting from the zsh directory to /usr/share/

Extract the zsh.tar.gz files to the home directory.
Now Reboot and enjoy
